# 📊 PhonePe Transaction Insights

An end-to-end business analytics dashboard built using real-world data from [PhonePe Pulse GitHub](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse). This project analyzes digital transactions across Indian states, user behavior, device usage, insurance penetration, and quarterly growth trends — and visualizes them in an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of digital payment platforms like PhonePe, it’s critical to understand:

- How people spend digitally across India
- Where usage is strongest (geographically & demographically)
- What transaction categories dominate
- When usage peaks and why
- Where PhonePe can grow next

This project solves these questions with structured data, visualizations, and dashboard-level storytelling.
